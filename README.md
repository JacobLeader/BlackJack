--- RULES ---
                                         
Card Values:
    Numbered cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value.
    Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are all worth 10.
    Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on which value is more beneficial to the player without exceeding 21.

Players Options:
    Hit: Take another card to try to get closer to 21. Players can hit multiple times until they decide to stand or they bust (go over 21).
    Stand: End their turn and keep their current hand.
    Double Down: Double their original bet and take only one more card, after which they must stand.
    Split: If the player's initial two cards are of equal value, they can split them into two separate hands and play each hand independently.
    Insurance: If the dealer's visible card is an Ace, players have the option to buy insurance, which is a side bet that pays out 2:1 if the dealer has Blackjack.    

Dealer Options:
    The dealer must hit until their hand reaches a value of 17 or higher.
    If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.

Winning and Losing:
    If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without going over, the player wins and receives a payout of 1:1 (unless the player has a Blackjack, see below).
    If the player's hand exceeds 21 (busts), they lose their bet.
    If the player's hand ties with the dealer's hand, it's a push, and the player neither wins nor loses.

Blackjack:
    If a player's initial two cards are an Ace and a card with a value of 10 (10, Jack, Queen, or King), they have Blackjack.
    A Blackjack typically pays out at 3:2 (i.e., the player receives 1.5 times their original bet).
    If both the player and the dealer have Blackjack, it's a push.
